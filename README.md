[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ecoindex-cli.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ecoindex-cli)

This tool provides an easy way to analyze websites with [Ecoindex](http://www.ecoindex.fr) from your local computer using multi-threading. You have the ability to:

- Make the analysis on multiple pages
- Define multiple screen resolution
- Make a recursive analysis from a given website

This CLI is built on top of [ecoindex-python](https://pypi.org/project/ecoindex/) with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/)

The output is always a CSV file with the results of the analysis.

> **Current limitation:** This does not work well with SPA.

## Requirements

- Python ^3.8
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Setup

```bash
pip install --user -U ecoindex-cli
```

## Use case

The cli gets 2 commands: `analyze` and `report` which can be used separately:

```bash
ecoindex-cli --help                                
```

```bash
Usage: ecoindex-cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Ecoindex cli to make analysis of webpages

Options:
  --install-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh]
                                  Install completion for the specified shell.
  --show-completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell|pwsh]
                                  Show completion for the specified shell, to
                                  copy it or customize the installation.

  --help                          Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  analyze  Make an ecoindex analysis of given webpages or website.
  report   If you already performed an ecoindex analysis and have your...
```

### Make a simple analysis

You give just one web url

```bash
ecoindex-cli analyze --url http://www.ecoindex.fr
```

<details><summary>Result</summary>

```bash
There are 1 url(s), do you want to process? [Y/n]:
1 urls for 1 window size
Processing  [####################################]  100%
üôåÔ∏è File /tmp/ecoindex-cli/output/www.ecoindex.fr/2021-04-20_164433/results.csv written !
```

</details>

> This makes an analysis with a screen resolution of 1920x1080px by default

### Set the output file

You can define the csv output file

```bash
ecoindex-cli analyze --url http://www.ecoindex.fr --output-file ~/ecoindex-results/ecoindex.csv
```

<details><summary>Result</summary>

```bash
üìÅÔ∏è Urls recorded in file `input/www.ecoindex.fr.csv`
There are 1 url(s), do you want to process? [Y/n]:
1 urls for 1 window size with 2 maximum workers
Processing  [####################################]  100%
üôåÔ∏è File /home/vvatelot/ecoindex-results/ecoindex.csv written !
```

</details>

### Export to JSON file

By default, the results are exported to a CSV file. But, you can specify to export the results to a JSON file.

```bash
ecoindex-cli analyze --url http://www.ecoindex.fr --export-format json
```

<details><summary>Result</summary>

```bash
üìÅÔ∏è Urls recorded in file `input/www.ecoindex.fr.csv`
There are 1 url(s), do you want to process? [Y/n]:
1 urls for 1 window size with 2 maximum workers
Processing  [####################################]  100%
üôåÔ∏è File /tmp/ecoindex-cli/output/www.ecoindex.fr/2022-03-05_215320/results.json written !
```

</details>

### Multiple url analysis

```bash
ecoindex-cli analyze --url http://www.ecoindex.fr --url https://www.greenit.fr/
```

<details><summary>Result</summary>

```bash
There are 2 url(s), do you want to process? [Y/n]:
2 urls for 1 window size with 2 maximum workers
Processing  [####################################]  100%
üôåÔ∏è File /tmp/ecoindex-cli/output/www.ecoindex.fr/2021-04-20_164524/results.csv written !
```

</details>

### Provide urls from a file

You can use a file with given urls that you want to analyze: One url per line. This is helpful if you want to play the same scenario recurrently.

```bash
ecoindex-cli analyze --urls-file input/ecoindex.csv
```

<details><summary>Result</summary>

```bash
There are 2 url(s), do you want to process? [Y/n]:
2 urls for 1 window size with 2 maximum workers
Processing  [####################################]  100%
üôåÔ∏è File /tmp/ecoindex-cli/output/www.ecoindex.fr/2021-04-20_164524/results.csv written !
```

</details>

### Make a recursive analysis

You can make a recursive analysis of a given webiste. This means that the app will try to find out all the pages into your website and launch an analysis on all those web pages. ‚ö†Ô∏è This can process for a very long time! **Use it at your own risks!**

```bash
ecoindex-cli analyze --url http://www.ecoindex.fr --recursive
```

<details><summary>Result</summary>

```bash
‚è≤Ô∏è Crawling root url http://www.ecoindex.fr -> Wait a minute !
üìÅÔ∏è Urls recorded in file `/tmp/ecoindex-cli/input/www.ecoindex.fr.csv`
There are 3 url(s), do you want to process? [Y/n]:
3 urls for 1 window size with 2 maximum workers
Processing  [####################################]  100%
üôåÔ∏è File /tmp/ecoindex-cli/output/www.ecoindex.fr/2021-04-20_164729/results.csv written !
```

</details>

### Using multi-threadging

You can use multi-threading to speed up the analysis when you have a lot of websites to analyze. In this case, you can define the maximum number of workers to use:

```bash
ecoindex-cli analyze --url http://www.ecoindex.fr --url https://www.greenit.fr/ --max-workers 10
```

<details><summary>Result</summary>

```bash
There are 2 url(s), do you want to process? [Y/n]:
2 urls for 1 window size with 10 maximum workers
Processing  [####################################]  100%
üôåÔ∏è File /tmp/ecoindex-cli/output/www.ecoindex.fr/2021-04-20_164524/results.csv written !
```

> By default, the number of maximum workers is set to CPU count.

</details>

### Disable console interaction

You can disable confirmations, and force the app to answer yes to all of them. It can be useful if you need to start the app from another script, or if you have no time to wait it to finish.

```bash
ecoindex-cli analyze --url http://www.ecoindex.fr --recursive --no-interaction
```

<details><summary>Result</summary>

```bash
‚è≤Ô∏è Crawling root url http://www.ecoindex.fr -> Wait a minute !
üìÅÔ∏è Urls recorded in file `/tmp/ecoindex-cli/input/www.ecoindex.fr.csv`
3 urls for 1 window size with 2 maximum workers
Processing  [####################################]  100%
üôåÔ∏è File /tmp/ecoindex-cli/output/www.ecoindex.fr/2021-11-04_081913/results.csv written !
```

</details>

### Set other screen resolutions

You can provide other screen resolutions. By default, the screen resolution is `1920x1080px` but you can provide other resolution for example if you want to test ecoindex for mobile.

```bash
ecoindex-cli analyze --url http://www.ecoindex.fr --window-size 1920,1080 --window-size 386,540
```

<details><summary>Result</summary>

```bash
There are 1 url(s), do you want to process? [Y/n]:
1 urls for 2 window size with 2 maximum workers
Processing  [####################################]  100%
üôåÔ∏è File /tmp/ecoindex-cli/output/www.ecoindex.fr/2021-04-21_212244/results.csv written !
```

</details>

### Generate a html report

You can generate a html report easily at the end of the analysis. You just have to add the option `--html-report`.

```bash
ecoindex-cli analyze --url http://www.ecoindex.fr --recursive --html-report
```

<details><summary>Result</summary>

```bash
‚è≤Ô∏è Crawling root url http://www.ecoindex.fr -> Wait a minute !
üìÅÔ∏è Urls recorded in file `input/www.ecoindex.fr.csv`
There are 3 url(s), do you want to process? [Y/n]:
3 urls for 1 window size with 2 maximum workers
Processing  [####################################]  100%
üôåÔ∏è File output/www.ecoindex.fr/2021-04-21_212127/results.csv written !
ü¶ÑÔ∏è Amazing! A report has been generated to /tmp/ecoindex-cli/output/www.ecoindex.fr/2021-04-21_212127/index.html
```

> When generating a html report, the results are written in a CSV file and you can not specify the result file location. So options `--export-format` and `--output-file` are ignored.

</details>

Here is a sample result:
![Sample report](doc/report.png)

### Only generate a report from existing result file

If you already performed an anlayzis and (for example), forgot to generate the html report, you do not need to re-run a full analyzis, you can simply request a report from your result file :

```bash
ecoindex-cli report "/tmp/ecoindex-cli/output/www.ecoindex.fr/2021-05-06_191355/results.csv" "www.synchrone.fr"
```

<details><summary>Result</summary>

```bash
ü¶ÑÔ∏è Amazing! A report has been generated to /tmp/ecoindex-cli/output/www.ecoindex.fr/2021-05-06_191355/index.html
```

</details>


## Results example
