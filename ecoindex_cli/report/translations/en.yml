ecoindex_body: |
  <p>The ecoindex is an indicator developed by the <a href="https://collectif.greenit.fr/outils.html" target="_blank">"Collectif Num√©rique Responsable"</a>.
  It allows you to analyze an html page and deduce a score based on three physical criteria of a web page.</p><br />
  <p>The calculation of the ecoindex makes it possible to deduce a standardized indicator (from A to G) making it possible to describe the environmental footprint of a page.</p><br />

requests_body: |
  <strong>The number of HTTP requests</strong> gives a good idea of the server load.
  To put it quickly and caricaturedly, the greater the number of requests for the same page, the more servers will be needed to serve this page.

size_body: |
  <strong>The weight of the data transferred (KB)</strong> reflects the effort required to transport the page to the browser.
  In this first version, we consider that the connection is Wi-Fi via ADSL.
  But in the next version we will take into account different types of connections, especially 4G.
  Indeed, a 4G connection requires up to 23 times more energy to transport the same amount of data as an ADSL connection.

nodes_body:
  <strong>The number of DOM elements</strong> testifies to the complexity of the site and therefore, a priori,
  efforts to be made by the browser to display the page.
  The more complex the site, the more power (especially CPU) it takes to display it.
  And the more it helps to shorten the life of the computer it is running on.
  Conversely, a particularly simple and light site contributes to extending the life of the equipment because it requires little memory and a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù processor.
